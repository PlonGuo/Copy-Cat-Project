Good Morning . Thank much . I really appreciate . I wanted come chat morning . I know ’ getting lots presentations week I ’ want big fancy presentation . What I want chat , get spend 45 minutes together I want talk whatever want talk . I opinions things … . I figured wanted start asking questions , ’ go good places . Just set tone little bit , I ’ actually pretty excited way things going . I think really good people met week running key areas Apple , I think making enormous progress toward executing pretty clear strategy . And strategy revolves around one fundamental concept , make really great products . And I believe firmly still sizable market really great products giant holes fill help . So , I open entertaining questions I hope good ones morning ! Focusing About Saying NO Question : What OpenDoc ? Steve : What OpenDoc ? What ? It ’ dead , right ? Well , let say something . I know spend lot time working stuff put bullet head . I apologize . But Apple suffered several years lousy engineering management . I say . And people going 18 different directions arguably interesting things one . Good engineers – lousy management . And happened look farm ’ created different animals going different directions ’ add . The total less sum parts . And decide , “ fundamental directions ’ going ? ” “ makes sense ’ ? ” And bunch things ’ . And micro-cosmically made sense , macro-cosmically made sense . The hardest thing … think focusing , right ? You think , “ well , focusing saying yes ” . No , focusing saying “ ” . Focusing saying . And ’ got say “ , , ” . When say , piss people . And go talk Santa Fe Mercury write shitty article . And ’ really pisser want nice , ’ want tell Santa Fe Mercury person asked leave . So take lumps . And Apple ’ taking share lumps last 6 months unfair way taking like adult . And I ’ proud . And come , I ’ sure . I read articles people left . I know people . They ’ done anything 7 years . And know , leave ’ like company ’ going fall apart next day . I think stories like , focusing saying . And result focus going really great products total much greater sum parts . And OpenDoc … I putting bullet head OpenDoc . I mean , I think great technology ’ fit . The rest world ’ going use OpenDoc . And I think container strategy stuff java space much better . And even OpenDoc guys basically trying rewrite whole thing java anyway , restart . So , ’ make sense . Yes , sir ? The Press Stock Price Take Care Themselves Question : What press ? Wall Street Journal reporters get morning , sell Apple short go write stories us . And , ’ clear ’ perception versus reality . They ’ know shit operating systems . They ’ know anything tools . They ’ know ’ going future . They ’ know ’ building icebergs building bottom . Sure . You know , I ’ sure lot experience ’ changing , ’ growing person people tend treat like 18 months ago . And ’ really frustrating sometimes ’ growing ’ becoming capable ’ personality quirks ’ kind gotten , whatever may . And people still treat like year 18 months ago . It frustrating . Well , ’ company . It ’ press . The press going lag time , best thing press embrace , best educate strategy . But key part keep eye prize . And turning great products , communicating directly customers best , giving community people going make stuff successful like loop know everything , marching forward one foot front . It ’ like stock price … press stock price take care . By end year , ’ going look quite different . And I ’ like old man industry I ’ seen ups downs see enough , know ’ going happen . So , get morning press selling Apple short , go buy shares . That ’ I would . That ’ I done . Proprietary Software versus Adopting Open Standards Apple certainly tradition introducing new technology , lately , Apple seems apologetic different proud different . I wondering years introducing Macintosh , Apple get ’ balls back . I got ta tell , I little different point view . I think Apple ’ head sand last many years . There much ’ happened terms network computing example , Apple ’ completely missed . The Mac probably one least network computer communities world terms really making use powerful networks . When Next joined Apple , Next extremely sophisticated network infrastructure network computing compared Apple even struggle getting Apple folks understand . Because Mac , proprietary-ness every way , attitude arrogance “ invent around networking invent around that… ” ’ little world rest world much invested passed . And , need bring Mac modern world many areas like network computing . And , ’ first , ’ set standards ’ already cast stone , use . So , I think wisdom say “ ’ got invent everything ” . The wisdom know 10 % 20 % 30 % probably stuff invent . And go use exists . We ’ invent postscript , ? We got LaserWriter . And first LaserWriter . So , I think whole notion proprietary every facet really hurt us . And , management vision encouraged . Encouraged people go reinvent wheel way . And yeah , might 10 % better usually , ended 50 % worse lot smart people ’ work Apple , . Related : Matt Mullenweg WordPress adopts Web Standards . Being Better More Important Being Different The thing I ’ like add I think ’ important Apple perceived different Apple says “ We ’ like everybody else better , really ’ say anything . No , I ’ think ’ good Apple perceived different . I think ’ important Apple perceived much better . And different essential , . But much better without different , would fine . I want much better . I ’ care different . We ’ different ways much better , ’ prize , ’ agree ? I would agree , Apple needs articulate differences well . The goal better , general public , whole lot better ways different . It whole lot better . From Local Storage Cloud Storage Good morning . You said opening ground rules lots holes Apple ’ necessarily without community . As visionary , think could spend couple minutes talking goals ? Sure . Much great leverage using computers days , using computationally intensive tasks using window communication-intensive tasks , know . And never I seen something powerful computation combined network technology . So , networks throughout organization , course , wide-area networks internet . And , I want focus something ’ close heart , living high-speed network world get job done every day . Now , many manage storage computers ? How many back computers , example ? How many crash last three years ? Four years ? Right . Ok , let describe world I live . About 8 years ago , high-speed networking connected obsolete Next hardware ( running Next time ) . And using NFS , able take personal data , “ home directories ” called , local machines put server . And software made completely transparent server lot RAM , cases , actually faster get stuff server get stuff local hard disk cases would cached RAM server popular use . But really remarkable organization could hire professional person back server every night , could afford spend little bit server , maybe redundant disk drives , redundant power supplies . And know , last 7 years , know many times I lost personal data ? Zero . Do know many times I back computer ? Zero . I computers Apple , NeXT , Pixar , home . I walk log . It goes network , finds home directory server , I ’ got stuff , wherever I . And none local hard disk . Gigabit Ethernet Enables Cloud Storage Now , ’ really interesting gigabit Ethernet coming . With gigabit Ethernet , faster every case talk server , local hard disk . One things I ’ really excited look personal computer take every moving part except keyboard mouse . I ’ need hard disk computer I get server faster . Because I look network connection MFS Dialtone , I get wire . And I ’ care ’ done . I ’ care box end . We big one NeXT , spend half million bucks . It worth . We lot software development . Nobody ever lost anything . Nobody worry stuff . You could smaller ones . But managing network like pain butt . Setting , getting work really complicated . One hopes Apple , new type network ( new , average person ’ new ) gigabit Ethernet technologies new server stuff ’ coming pike thinner hardware clients , Apple could make plug play mere mortals made user experience decade ago . That ’ one things I think ’ giant hole I ’ communicate awesome unless use . And would decide within day two carrying around non-connected computers computers tons data state byzantine comparison . So , 3 4 things like , enormous opportunity lot times people organizations , greatest strength also greatest weakness greatest weakness greatest strength . Implement A Vision Faster Through End-to-End Product Design Apple highlighted incredibly great weakness totally vertically integrated . It ’ make semi-conductors makes hardware , makes software , controls user experience , marketing . And many people constantly calling Apple get hardware business weakness perceive . I ’ agree . I perceive potential weakness managed right . I also perceive Apple ’ greatest strength managed right . I ’ give example : plug play . To get anything done PC industry , seems take years . Plug Play initiative launched 5 years ago . It took 2 years get together Microsoft Compaq Intel fought finally got Intel fold… 5 years later , still , ’ really work . You imagine long take make thin client standard servers plug play within clients easily . We ’ third millennium . So , fact Apple controls product design end end : hardware , software , gives Apple incredibly unique opportunity . The company industry . An incredibly unique opportunity tackle really complex problems could enormous potential advantage market could solve . And I think solve literally half decade decade sooner 93 headed monster Intel space . Now , advantages , ’ get wrong . But I think one great advantages really control disciplines actually implement vision much faster get going directions . Opportunities Software Developer Ecosystem That sounded really great , talking I getting sort caught . And occurred : That ’ really great vision Apple . But , I asked holes developers . I ’ give tons simple ones . Microsoft ’ committed port suite applications yet , ? For Rhapsody . What waiting ? Adobe – know many copies Photoshop Adobe ships every month ? Bazillions ! That ’ foundation Adobe , Photoshop . Adobe , knowledge , committed port Photoshop Rhapsody yet . What waiting ? There company called Lighthouse , actually bought Sun 6 months ago . They best NeXTSTEP developer . They 18 developers , ok ? They far away best presentation application I ’ seen life called Concurrence . I still use today . They suite 5 different apps . And one best breed . The best spreadsheet I ’ ever used life , called Quantrix . How many use Improv ? Ok , Improv best spreadsheet planet , incorporates whole new way thinking spreadsheets people like want model things . It ’ phenomenally powerful . And Lotus ’ compete , gave Lighthouse copied . 18 developers , 5 apps , power development environment . Software Development App Marketing What Apple going putting hands system build apps 5 10 times faster anything . Period . And choose one two things somewhere middle power . Make existing complexity apps , 5 10 times faster You make existing complexity apps 5-10 times faster , means 3 people really go garage day one concept come market product 6-9 months later . I ’ seen industry 10 12 years . And ’ , , exciting . And people say , “ Well , run Macintosh , run Rhapsody selling Intel maybe selling Macintosh . Jesus , ’ single-digit percentage market. ” Well , Jesus , ’ 3+ million copies year . I ’ mind selling market . It ’ huge , especially ’ 3-person , 10-person , 18-person software development company . Lighthouse making good living selling NeXTSTEP market . Give break ! So , know , I think ’ huge market . And , I think ’ still tremendous loyalty towards Apple customers . If Adobe ’ want write next generation Photoshop Rhapsody , ! Maybe ’ buy you… knows ? But , publishing market would love see next generation even , know would love even ? Apple . Right ? You walk say “ I ’ got something ’ 5 times better Photoshop publishing people ” . And enough publishing people agree convince Apple ’ really case … know much Apple spends marketing year ? They spend apps . And telling world . So , come something really great , I think ’ going get . And I think pretty unique opportunity . Build app could build platform I want get back last point I making . One things powerful tools addition building current complexity 5-10 times faster , building app ’ build platform . And exciting . Build app could build platform ’ managing complexity , right ? You developers , know . It ’ managing complexity . It ’ like scaffolding , right ? You erect scaffolding , keep going , eventually , scaffolding collapses weight , right ? That ’ building software . It ’ much scaffolding erect whole thing collapses weight . It ’ matter many people working . It ’ matter ’ Microsoft 300-400 people , 500 people team . It collapse weight . You read “ The Mythical Man-Month ” , right ? The basic premise software development project gets certain size add one person . The amount energy actually communicate person actually greater net contribution project slows . So local maximum slows . We know software . It ’ managing complexity . These tools allow worry 90 % stuff worry , erect 5 stories scaffolding , starting story number 23 instead starting story number 6 . You get lot higher . You mentioned stocks really look forward toward end year . I ’ wondering , make comment whatsoever Larry Ellison ? There lots comments one could make Larry Ellison . I ’ never dated Larry , excludes bunch . No , actually Larry best friend , put slightly awkward situation . I certainly encouraged seek take control Apple I think Apple good course right . And I think Larry awesome course . I mean , one things I told , “ Look , took poll Silicon Valley company ’ like run , Oracle would top many people ’ lists . Second largest software company world , one dynamic companies planet. ” And Larry built scratch ’ got one greatest jobs world . So I think Larry made public pronouncement ’ going stick running Oracle . So , I ’ worry . And I think need worry making great products getting applications telling customers things . How Compete Industry Leaders : Build What You Friends Want A weeks ago , The Wall Street Journal announced profit figures Microsoft . And also said industry , companies really well Intel , Microsoft perhaps Compaq . Could comment possibility competing monopolies justice department seems strange reason avoid prosecuting antitrust ? The day started Apple computer , IBM far powerful computer industry Microsoft Intel today . Because controlled technology , controlled customer . They direct contact customer . And , , get . I mean , I nudged Woz said “ Hey , forget . Not chance ” . But , stupid know . We ’ gone business school . We ’ read Wall Street Journal . We ’ know Wall Street Journal . I ’ never seen Wall Street Journal . And served us well . And , I say ? I think every good product I ’ ever seen industry pretty much anywhere , group people cares deeply making something wonderful friends wanted . They want use . And ’ Apple I came , ’ Apple II came , ’ Macintosh came . That ’ almost everything I know ’ good come . It ’ come people trembling corner worried big company stomping . Because , big company made product right , things ’ happened . If Woz I could plunked 2000 bucks bought Apple II , would built one ? We ’ trying start company ; trying get computer . I ’ give example . I get 200 email messages day , sans get rich quick ones Internet . And I ’ mode 5-6-7 years . And email , , important app I use . And I ’ used every email system I know , I tell one NeXTSTEP Rhapsody literally almost order magnitude better , productive , anything else I know . I mean , I walk around Apple using worst email system world . And I know could improve productivity inside Apple 30 % give good email system . And , ’ amazing something obvious email broken . Netscape ’ awful . I mean , everybody ’ awful . And something obvious email broken … one I mentioned : spreadsheets . If use Improv Quantrix week , would go , “ How come ’ completely replaced Excel ? ” 75 % people . 25 % still want Excel , good reason . But 75 % people , ’ replaced ? And answers questions except – “ let ’ go ! ” And ’ attitude thing . Apple Competing Microsoft The thing I feel , , strongly : It ’ incredibly stupid Apple get position Apple win , Microsoft lose . That ’ really dumb . I mean , I ’ expect Federal Government break Microsoft . For lot reasons , least Federal Government monopoly . I mean – ’ buddies ! So , Microsoft fact life . They ’ like air breathe , know ? So , probably better analogy like bottled water buy . TODO : LINK PROPRIETORY But nonetheless , Apple win without Microsoft lose . I firmly believe . And hopefully , Microsoft increasingly , time , realize case Apple represents quite profitable part business . And seem coming around point view . An alliance announced Microsoft Apple . So , I really really strongly feel setting Microsoft Satan holy war Microsoft would exactly wrong thing Apple . There many opportunities Apple really tremendous advantage go head head Microsoft , really go right customers . Pricing Licensing Apple ’ Operating System Rhapsody I hoping would venture opinion morning see future evolution Macintosh compatible market . This personal opinion . I believe Apple license everything . With exceptions . But I think Apple get fair price . And I think clone set , way set done really poorly – 3 4 years ago . For one thing , Apple licenses hardware design forces clone makers use . That ’ stupid . Let clone makers hardware design – let whatever hardware want . Right ? Don ’ tie hands . But want pay extra , want use Apple hardware . Fine , ’ , let design . And software , Apple get fair price based volume . As example , I ’ clone maker – know , low-end Macintoshes , whether compatibles , probably ’ make much money . As matter fact , could even imagine might lose money get people fold . And , offset kinds low margin products , need higher-margin products high-end . So ’ clone maker think , “ Wow , I think I ’ give Apple ten bucks software I ’ go $ 5000 Mac market . Well , would really stupid Apple . Because clone maker leech . They living fact Apple got business model make much money levels try eek back high levels going high level paying ten bucks software , ’ fair . So want people pay money lower volume way get higher volume make medium low priced clones , , make less margin . And ’ , ought get lower price across whole range products . So I ’ advocating eliminate licensing hardware let clone makers whatever want , b ) raise price royalty software reasonable level make scale based volume . And I think ’ right thing . Some clone makers going ballistic . It ’ incredibly stupid . I mean , I ’ ought pay Rhapsody , example , modern operating systems licensing . But ’ 10 20 30 bucks . And I think ’ ’ end I think everybody fine I think clone makers much easier time ’ deal Apple ’ hardware . Maybe ’ make better hardware maybe ’ make worse hardware customers decide . And I ’ . I think Apple ought get little bit value software clone makers picking high margin products paying ten bucks copy . If want pick high margin products pay fair price software , let . So , ’ I feel . But I ’ making decision . Empowering Developers Serve Market Even , I ’ glad ’ . You mentioned managing complexity . There ’ lot people either using computers think computers something babysit- work computers . How get computers work people instead ? I ’ really know . I ’ sure mean . I ’ feel I work computer . I feel ’ little invasive – I mean , I T1 house sort getting habit answering emails within seconds arrive , invasive family life . But … . How serve us go things us without us sort watch ? We whole system “ I click , computer one thing… I click another thing… . It never goes works 15 minutes… . I mean… . I guess point view little bit different : My point view I ’ routinely running 10-15 applications computer ; They routinely talking wonderful way I ’ pay much attention , I move things easily ; And I ’ connected extremely high-speed easy transparent productive way colleagues . It ’ much better anything I see Windows Mac world today . That I happy next 12 24 months , guys roll apps , bring everybody . Secondly , I know least 20 apps I ’ love using , ’ written yet . And make apps really easy write , keep Mac market far less expensive market Intel market , get chance use great apps guys going write . So , view next several years , like 3-4 years , job reinvent world . It ’ take something know exists already hardly anybody ’ got , get . To honest , ’ lot like Xerox Parc . Xerox Parc things Macintosh , nobody else . There thousands people use , ’ millions get , I think ’ going change lot . And , fortunately , lot tried true polished refined pretty bulletproof ’ going go embarrassing early moments , I hope . Programmer Productivity That would cool . You mentioned tools . There great , wonderful NeXTSTEP demo visual way building interface – ’ great . And , sudden , ’ back text . When visually program ? Here ’ deal . The way get programmer productivity increasing lines code per programmer per day . That ’ work . The way get programmer productivity eliminating lines code write . Right ? The line code ’ fastest write , never breaks , ’ need maintenance , line never write – right ? So , goal eliminate 80 % code write app . That ’ goal . And , along way , provide WYS –this WYS-that , visual , visual , … well , ’ fine , high order bit eliminate 80 % code . When drag line interface builder ’ eliminating line code one form . But goes far . Maybe go . I ’ seen lot demos try take way back algorithmic part code base , none ever good . If good ones , show Bobby ’ show . I would love see . Controlling Hardware You mentioned good Apple controls hardware . There seems conflict interest Apple ’ hardware cloning hardware . I ’ believe ’ true . The person running hardware Apple , I ’ known decade . His name John Rubenstein . I trust life . He ’ best hardware leader I ’ ever seen life . He ’ really really really good . He comes high-performance systems expertise , putting lot high-performance systems [ make ] really cheap . He ’ really good , really good leading teams , really good talented engineering managers engineers . And wants build kick-ass stuff . Because Mac hardware top food chain . And want get . And going get . So , something ready go really good , I promise , John would shipping yesterday . Ok ? And terms clone makers , I know John pushing strongly , I support 100 % , tell clone makers build hardware . That ’ easiest thing . Don ’ limited Apple release . Build . There billion people building hardware . Look PC clone business . They build hardware . They could people build . They could people design . So release bondage use Apple hardware . And whatever want . Matter fact , could build Rhapsody boxes Intel processors wanted . They could whatever wanted . And ’ I ’ hoping Apple goes . So ’ see conflict ? No , I ’ . All I tell I know 100 % true . If Apple hot product , would shipping tomorrow . Ok ? And shipped hot products recently . And next batch coming , ’ shipping instantly . Apple hot products . And , nothing held ’ good . I guarantee . Marketing Apple Television , PR , Newspapers OK , Apple turned around . We ’ got Gil , ’ got , ’ got G3 , ’ got Rhapsody , ’ got Newton 2000 . Great . Now , going see real kick-ass TV commercials change mindset ? Let go preamble little bit . I personally ’ think Apple completely turned around . I think ’ turning around . And I ’ put past tense . I think ’ like right . And I feel confident team ’ managing pieces Apple right . I think ’ really good job . And strategy I think pretty doggone good . I feel good I think ’ turning around I think ’ going see signs . I ’ give opinion marketing suggestive thing . It ’ science . There ’ lot art . And , personal belief medium really communicate lot message . In cases , medium overrides message . And I personally believe Apple television year . It ’ wrong place Apple . Because means Apple trying spend lot money convince everything ok. And I think Apple ought taking fraction money putting print . And I ’ mean 8 page Wall Street Journal ads . Because , 8 page Wall Street Journal ad saying “ I ’ going spend wad show I ’ back ” . And Apple needs spending million dollars tell people ’ back . It needs journalists saying Apple back page 1 . Because page 7-14 Apple spends million dollars saying ’ back page 1 , journalist writes article saying ’ tank , going believe ? As matter fact , million bucks page 7-14 going reinforce message page 1 . Meanwhile , ’ TV commercials influencing sales . You know , I ’ buy . I ’ buy . I ’ think ’ true . I think anything right , PR influencing purchase consideration category . Not advertising . So , I ’ minority , I certain degree experience matter . And I believe strongly Apple really needs talk great products , great customers great applications . And best way print straightforward way . And I also believe strongly high order bit marketing campaign profitability . We send boatload money quarter marketing . If lose money quarter , positive momentum ’ created completely erased . Profitability high order bit marketing Apple point time . And I think ’ approaching I think use every ounce financial resources get I think strong loudly heard . I think focus PR I think focus print advertising stay television year , I ’ make decisions . So ’ recommendation I ’ given Apple . Start customer experience , work backward technology Steve Jobs WWDC , 1997 . Here 's full searchable transcript ! Steve Jobs WWDC , 1997 I would like , example , express clear terms Java , incarnations , addresses ideas embodied OpenDoc . And ’ finished , perhaps could tell us personally last 7 years . You know … please people , time . One hardest things , ’ trying effect change , people like gentleman right areas . I ’ sure things OpenDoc , probably even I ’ familiar , nothing else . And I ’ sure could make demos , maybe small commercial app , demonstrates things . The hardest thing : fit , cohesive , larger vision , ’ going allow sell 8 billion dollars , 10 billion dollars product year ? And , one things I ’ always found ’ got start customer experience work backward technology . You ’ start technology try figure ’ going try sell . And I made mistake probably anybody else room . And I got scar tissue prove . And I know ’ case . And tried come strategy vision Apple , started “ What incredible benefits give customer ? Where take customer ? ” Not starting “ Let ’ sit engineers figure awesome technology going market ? ” And I think ’ right path take . I remember Laser Writer . We built world ’ first small laser printer , know . And awesome technology box . We first Canon cheap laser-printing engineer United States Apple . We wonderful printer controller designed . We Adobe ’ PostScript software , AppleTalk . Just awesome technology box . And I remember seeing first print , come . And picking looking thinking , “ You know , sell ” . Because ’ know anything ’ box . All hold say , “ Do want ? ” And remember , back 1984 , laser printers , pretty startling see . People went , “ Whoa , yes ! ” . And ’ Apple ’ got get back . And know , I ’ sorry OpenDoc casualty along way , I readily admit many things life I ’ faintest idea I ’ talking . So , I apologize , ’ whole lot people working super hard right Apple . Avie , John , … , Fred . The whole team working , burning midnight oil , hundreds people , execute things ’ best . And mistakes made along way , ’ good least decisions made along way . When find mistake ’ fix . I think need support team going important stage , work butts . They ’ getting calls offered three times much money go . None leaving . And I think need support write damn good applications support Apple market . That ’ point view . Mistakes made , people pissed , people know ’ talking , I think ’ much better things long ago . And I think ’ going get . So , I think ’ got time questions . How Convince Corporates Stay Experimental Software I work large corporation seriously reconsidering development targeting Macintosh . They sent last year ’ WWDC I came back lot new technology I really impressed “ We Gil board , ’ got next-generation OS ’ moving forward . I ’ lost bit credibility . Now , Monday morning , I ’ got go back say “ Now , really mean time . We ’ got great new technology I really believe new strategy. ” If software developer like , works Fortune 500 corporation , would tell people convince stay Macintosh ? Good question . Let ask questions : use primarily shelf applications roll apps ? It depends item ’ talking . Mostly I use Code Warrior I use Photoshop word processing things . The things I write generally company things I ’ written . I guess ’ saying ’ trying convince company stay Macintoshes . Does company use Macintoshes employ custom apps write company company use Macintoshes employ primarily shrink-wrapped apps ? Mostly support-software hardware sell targeted PCs Macs . Do write software ? Yes , . Well , one things could say , could write software 5-10 times faster deploy Mac Rhapsody Intel PCs , would interest ? I think would . I would throw mix arguments I would use . And thing I would … Guarino Deluca . He runs marketing Apple . Go , find guy . He ’ actually got white paper get hands . Focussing Connectivity , instead Individual Computers A ago , Apple vision user interface . I ’ work , machine would using agent software , knowledge navigator , intelligent agents . Are going see like sometime soon ? Because I ’ signed . It turns much headroom make network world live much productive , much easier much fun know . It ’ research . We know . That bet future right results research agent world , pick sorts magazines read people spouting . There ’ nothing tangible . It research moment . To bet future , bet next 5 years research – something tangible know , feel , touch – would foolish . The core strategy take advantage dramatic headroom make connected world much productive rest us , rather individual computer , original vision Mac . To take next big leap make connected world much productive … ’ ’ . Not ’ working agents . There people working agents back . But core strategy focused I said . And , I think ’ right . I think point , ’ going start us ways ’ imagine . But even get , make life 5 times better even without research successful . What think Apple Newton ? I ’ minority . And I think ’ really matter . I think companies ’ successful one stack system software . Rarely manage two . And , I believe , going succeed managing 2 next several years Mac OS Rhapsody , superset . I imagine successful trying manage three . So , I sort law physics disconnect trying . I ’ see done . And I ’ think anything good bad Newton , whether making 800 dollar products 500 products , I think . It – I ’ see manage 3 software stacks . So ’ I think . Do actually Newton user ? I tried Newton . I bought one . I bought one early ones . I thought piece junk . I threw away . I bought one Motorola Envoys , I thought piece junk using 3 months . I threw away . I hear new ones lot better . I ’ tried one . I , see ’ problem : problem , high order bit connectivity . The high order bit touch , connected network . That ’ I bought Envoy . It cellular modem . And I ’ think world keeping life little thing . I ’ already getting computer I get back base station . To , I want , little thing I carry around ’ got keyboard . Because email need keyboard . And need connected net . So somebody would make little thing ’ connected net times , little keyboard modem , I ’ like buy one . But I ’ see one . And I ’ care OS . So , I ’ want little scribble thing . But ’ . One last question . Reorganizing Managing Apple This going back PR marketing . First , would interested taking slightly evangelistic role within company yes , single person , minority , speak , talk lot effects basically , stone pond produces lot ripples . The second thing ties – marketing side – going print , makes sense . And going get writers write stories back things positive effect ’ correct . But marketing side house seems sync everything else . In particular , marketing agencies . What would take Apple work marketing agency vested interest making things successful ? Personally speaking , I ’ feel president marketing organization Apple ’ best interest heart . Because ’ hungry . They drive . They reason make something fly ’ , die along . Let answer questions reverse order . I think Apple needs working really great agencies . I ’ care hungry ’ . I ’ care ’ west coast east coast . They need great . The results need great . The customers ’ going measure us people tried hungry . They ’ going measure us see . And I agree . I ’ think 100 % people Apple working great . And I think person running marketing , Guarino Deluca really good , knows working things priority list . And ’ starting important ones working way . And , I think point view absolutely shared . And take months see things happen probably months get results important things need done . And done . In terms role , Apple bought NeXT , Gil asked advisor I agreed told go away I decided ’ listening . And neither occurred . And I ’ grateful opportunity like working strategic issues . The area I really concentrated energy last several months help Gil re-architect organization company senior lieutenants . And company went divisionally oriented company zillion P & L centers complicated – simple organization . Very functionally organized : Avie Tevanian came ’ running software . I think Avie really first-rate . I think ’ one best software executives planet . And I think ’ really good job . John Rubenstein came run hardware , I talked little bit John earlier . He tops . Guarino Deluca running marketing . He previously ran Claris I think ’ fine job . Fred Anderson , CFO , top-notch . And rest team well . Manufacturing etcetera , good . So , I feel like team execute plan pretty strong , working well together team . To , ’ high order bit . It ’ going around giving speeches things like . Apple ’ problem lack air volume , coming Apple . It ’ execution lack good management . It ’ basic stuff . And I think basics getting put place . And large extent , ’ already put place . And ’ filtering organization . Results ’ happen overnight , I think ’ starting happen already . From new products , I think , good , I think end year ’ going much clearer things going like . So , suggestion ’ get freaked Microsoft freaked IBM started Apple . Even though may fully see , key change Apple management company . There strong people running functional organization . I lot confidence senior team company execute I think ’ going . I think move Rhapsody represents discontinuous opportunity software developers compete make really great products . And Rhapsody going run everything , PCs new Macs , even old Mac OS , I think ’ tremendous opportunity embrace new stuff . So , I , I would go buy box runs Rhapsody start taking look , start developing code . And I think ’ going blown away . And I think ’ opportunity make really wonderful apps customer base , tens millions people , really start zoom ahead rest whole industry . The capabilities , experience fun . And lot going I really hope embrace much team Apple . Because chance something really good . I really appreciate chance come hear questions hopefully answer . Thank .
